IoT Water Monitoring and Conservation is a project that aims to monitor and conserve water usage in real-time. The project utilizes sensors and devices to track the flow and turbidity of water supply and maintain the water level of a water tank or reservoir within a predetermined range. The project also logs The data is logged to an SD card and can be accessed for analysis via a webpage.

The project is a beneficial for anyone who wants to monitor and manage their water usage more effectively. By implementing this system, individuals and organizations can positively impact the environment. Whether you are a homeowner, farmer, business owner, or environmentalist, this project can help save water, reduce waste, save utility bills, and assist decision-making.

The hardware used in the project includes a DOIT ESP32 DevKit V1 board for controlling operations, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for measuring water level, a YF-S201C flow sensor for measuring flow rate, a turbidity sensor module for measuring water turbidity, an SD card module, an SD card for storing data, a DS3231 RTC module for timestamping recorded data, a DC water pump for pumping water, and a relay module for switching the water pump.

The project can measure the water level using an ultrasonic distance sensor and turn the pump on or off as needed to maintain the water level within a certain range. The YF-S201C flow sensor measures the flow rate and logs data to an SD card, including date and time stamps, turbidity, and total water flow. The project provides a web interface for viewing the data log and downloading data files.

In summary, IoT Water Monitoring and Conservation is a practical and efficient project for conserving water usage. The project provides an effective solution for monitoring and managing water usage and can benefit anyone who wants to conserve water and make a positive impact on the environment.
